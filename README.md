# born-quiz

A simple quiz that uses Vue and firestore.

For small applications like this I like to use Vue for its simplicity, flexible work-style and ability to easy integrate it into other apps. 

The Firestore database and authentication from firebase is easy and quick to use for scalable small apps like this, and easy for maintaining/monitoring users.

The quiz questions and answers are taken from the Open Trivia API.
